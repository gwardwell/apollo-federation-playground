# Listing Collection Example

This example illustrated federated collections of items (Listing Collections).
These collections leverage server-driven layouts and federated separation of concerns.

## Composable

The schema is designed to be composable, leveraging interfaces for easier client operations.

## Federated

The layouts are driven by a CMS, with products within the listing collection and the product
data being provided via federation.
